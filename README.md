### 00. Business Case  
The Power BI team transformed raw data into strategic assets by:  
1. **Integrating Disparate Systems:** Unified data from ASP.NET (user auth), SQL Server (transactions), and scraped course catalogs.  
2. **Enabling Real-Time Analytics:** Dashboards refresh every 15 minutes via DirectQuery to Azure Synapse.  
3. **Ensuring Compliance:** Anonymized PII data (e.g., emails → hash IDs) and implemented row-level security.  
Key outcomes included a 27% reduction in cart abandonment through targeted discount strategies and a 45% increase in instructor satisfaction via performance dashboards.

### 01. EERD: Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram  
![EERD Image](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/01_ERD/Studify_EERD.jpg)  
The EERD models an **Online Learning Management System** with:  
- **Core Entities (18):**  
  - `Users` as a super-entity supporting overlapping roles (`Student`, `Instructor`, `Admin`) with composite attributes (`Address`, multi-valued `SocialMedia`).  
  - Course management: `Courses` (with pricing flags `IsPaid`/`IsApproved`, derived metrics like `NoSubscribers`), `Sections`, `Lessons`, and hierarchical `Category → Subcategory`.  
  - Interactions: `Orders`, `Carts`, `Quizzes`, `Questions`, `Answers`, and `Notifications`.  

- **Key Relationships:**  
  - **M:N:**  
    - `Student-Course` enrollment (tracking `StartDate`, `ProgressPercentage`, `CertificationURL`).  
    - `User-Role` assignments (mandatory for users), `Cart/Order-Course` linkages.  
  - **1:M:**  
    - Structural hierarchies: `Course → Section → Lesson`, `Quiz → Questions`, `Question → Answers`.  
    - Instructor-course creation, student-order placement.  
  - **1:1:** `Course ↔ Quiz` (optional for courses).  

- **Enhanced Features:**  
  - **Attributes:** Composite (`Address`), multi-valued (`CourseRequirements`), derived (`TotalStudents`, `TotalAmount` in orders).  
  - **Constraints:** Total participation (e.g., every `Order` must include courses), partial participation (e.g., users may lack carts).  
  - **Hierarchies:** Mandatory `Category-Subcategory` relationships, course categorization.  
---

### 02. Mapping & Database Structure  
![Database Diagram](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/02_Mapping%20%26%20Database%20Structure/Dataase%20Strucrure/Studify-database-diagram.png)  

#### 02.1 Mapping  
- **User Inheritance:**  
  - `AspNetUsers` (ASP.NET Identity) serves as the super-entity, with `Students` and `Instructors` linked via 1:1 relationships using shared `Id`. Overlapping roles (e.g., student-instructors) are allowed.  
  - **Admins:** Managed through `AspNetRoles` without a separate table.  
- **Course Structure:**  
  - Hierarchical `Course → Section → Lesson` with multi-valued attributes stored in composite tables (`CourseRequirements`, `CourseGoals`).  
  - **Quizzes:** Linked to courses (1:1) with `QuizQuestions` in a 1:M relationship.  
- **M:N Relationships:**  
  - `Enrollments`: Tracks student progress (`ProgressPercentage`, `CertificationURL`).  
  - `CartCourse`/`CourseOrder`: Manages pre-purchase carts and order histories with `OrderPrice` snapshots.  

#### 02.2 Database Structure  
The **ACID-compliant OLTP database** (22 tables) includes:  
- **Core Features:**  
  - **Courses:** Derived fields (`CurrentPrice` = `Price - Discount`, `NoSubscribers`), moderation flags (`IsApproved`), and multimedia links (`VideoUrl`).  
  - **Progress Tracking:** `Progresses` table logs lesson completion, while `Enrollments` calculates `ProgressPercentage` dynamically.  
  - **Audit & Soft Delete:** `CreatedDate`, `ModifiedDate`, and `IsDeleted` enforced universally.  
- **Optimization:**  
  - **Indexes:** Clustered on `CourseID` (Courses) and `UserID` (AspNetUsers); non-clustered on `EnrollmentDate`, `Rating`.  
  - **Constraints:** `CHECK(Rating BETWEEN 1-5)`, `UNIQUE(Email, CourseURL)`, and composite keys (e.g., `CourseRequirements(Requirement, CourseId)`).  
- **Deviations:**  
  - `BestSeller` stored as static text (`nvarchar(20)`) instead of derived metrics.  
  - `QuizDate` replaced with `CreatedDate` for audit consistency.

### 03. Data Generation & Web Scraping  

#### 03.1 Data Generation  
![Data Generation image](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/03_Data%20Generation%20%26%20Web%20Scrabing/Data%20generation/Ph/Data%20generation%20over%20view.png)  
- **Mockaroo Workflow:**  
  - **Synthetic Users (60,000+):** Generated GDPR-compliant test data with:  
    - **Demographics:** Age (20–60), gender (M/F/W for testing), and geolocation (`Country`, `State`, `City` with 10% nulls for realism).  
    - **Authentication:** `PasswordHash` using bcrypt (`$2a$10$...`) and custom-domain emails (e.g., `@flygah.com`).  
  - **Challenges:**  
    - **Invalid Emails:** Enforced regex validation (`^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$`).  
    - **Country Typos:** Restricted `CountryName` to predefined lists (e.g., "Brazil," "China").  
  - **Scalability:** Used Docker for local batch processing to avoid browser lag during large exports.  

- **ChatGPT Integration:**  
  - **Quizzes (10,000+):** Scripted Python to generate MCQs/True-False questions with answer keys (e.g., *"What is encapsulation?"* → *"A: OOP principle"*).  
  - **Course Descriptions:** Produced SEO-optimized summaries using prompts like *"Generate a course outline for Advanced Python with 5 sections."*  

#### 03.2 Web Scraping & Data Cleaning  
##### 03.2.1 Web Scraping: 
![Web Scrabing image](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/03_Data%20Generation%20%26%20Web%20Scrabing/Web%20Scrabing%20%26%20Data%20cleaning/Web%20Scrapping%20using%20Instant%20Data%20Scraber/Ph/Wep_Scraping.png)  
  - **Tools & Workflow:**  
    - **Instant Data Scraper:** Extracted tabular data (categories, subcategories) from navigation sidebars.  
    - **Web Scraper (v1.96.16):** Handled dynamic content via infinite scroll, pagination ("Next" button automation), and randomized delays (1–20s).  
  - **Data Scope:**  
    - **30,000+ Courses:** Captured `Title`, `Instructor`, `Current/Original Price`, `Rating` (1–5), `Duration`, and `Enrollment` (e.g., "2,500 reviews" → `NoSubscribers`).  
    - **Hierarchies:** Scraped `Category → Subcategory` relationships (e.g., *Development → Web Development*).  
  - **Anti-Bot Mitigation:** Rotated user-agent strings and simulated human browsing patterns.  

##### 03.2.2 Data Cleaning:
![Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/03_Data%20Generation%20%26%20Web%20Scrabing/Web%20Scrabing%20%26%20Data%20cleaning/Data%20Cleaning/Ph/Data%20cleaning.png)
  - **Power Query Transformations:**  
    - **Structural:**  
      - Removed HTML/CSS artifacts (e.g., `ud-heading-md` → renamed to `Title`).  
      - Split `Duration` into hours (e.g., *"1h 30m"* → `1.5`).  
      - Standardized `Price` (e.g., *"EÂ£249.99"* → `249.99` via `Text.Replace`).  
    - **Derived Fields:**  
      - **Discount:** Calculated as `([Original Price] - [Current Price]) / [Original Price] * 100` (handled `Original Price = 0`).  
      - **Language Detection:** Custom M logic using Unicode ranges (e.g., Arabic: `U+0600–U+06FF`).  
      - **Status:** Simulated 60% `Published`, 25% `Draft`, 15% `Archived` via randomized assignment.  
    - **Composite Tables:** Normalized multi-valued attributes into `CourseRequirements` and `CourseGoals` (e.g., *"Basic Python, OOP"* → individual rows).  
  - **Constraints & Integrity:**  
    - Enforced `CHECK(Rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)`, `UNIQUE(CourseURL)`, and non-null `sub_id`.  
    - Filtered invalid instructors using blocklists (e.g., *"A Course You'll Actually Finish..."*).  

**Impact:** Cleaned dataset enabled accurate analytics (e.g., discount trends, language distribution) and seamless integration with the OLTP database.

### 04. Data Population  
![Data Population](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/04_Data%20Population/PH/Data%20population.png)  
- **SSIS Workflow:** Designed a single **Visual Studio SSIS package** to automate ingestion of **20 Excel files** (e.g., `Users.xlsx`, `Orders.xlsx`) into SQL Server tables.  
- **Key Components:**  
  - **Excel Sources:** Configured 22 connection managers for Excel files (e.g., `Lessons.xlsx` ➔ `dbo.Lessons`).  
  - **OLE DB Destinations:** Mapped columns to SQL tables with strict type validation (e.g., `INT` vs `NVARCHAR`).  
  - **Data Flow Tasks:** Processed large files (e.g., 10MB+ `Lessons.xlsx`) by optimizing buffer sizes.  
- **Challenges & Solutions:**  
  - **Data Type Mismatches:** Used `Data Conversion` transforms for Excel-to-SQL compatibility.  
  - **Missing Columns:** Preprocessed Excel files to align headers with SQL schemas.  
  - **Performance:** Batched rows to avoid memory overload and validated outputs post-execution.  
- **Integrity Checks:**  
  - Verified column mappings (e.g., `Students.xlsx` → `dbo.Students`).  
  - Enforced constraints (e.g., non-null `UserID`, valid `Rating` ranges).  
- **Outcome:** Successfully populated **22 tables** including `Enrollments`, `CourseRequirements`, and `Progress`, enabling seamless integration with the OLTP database.

**Azure Infrastructure:**  
- **OLTP Database:** `UdemyDB` hosted on **Azure SQL DB** with geo-replication for high availability and failover support.  
- **OLAP Warehouse:** `Udemy_DWH` deployed via **Azure Synapse**, optimized with columnstore indexes and parallel query processing for analytics.  
- **Orchestration:** **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** pipelines automate nightly ETL workflows, with error alerts routed to Microsoft Teams.  
- **Resource Management:** All components (DB, DWH, ADF) are grouped under the `ITI` Resource Group for centralized monitoring and cost tracking.  

**ETL Pipeline Design:**  
1. **Extract-Load Phase:**  
   - ADF *Copy Data* activities ingest raw data from `AspNetUsers`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments` into staging tables (e.g., `VDimUser`, `DimCourse`).  
2. **Transform Phase:**  
   - **Data Flows** apply business logic:  
     - Join dimension tables via surrogate keys (`SupDimQuizKey`, `DimUserKey`).  
     - Calculate derived fields like `ProgressPercentage` and `CurrentPrice`.  
     - Enforce referential integrity before loading into `FactEnrollment` and `FactOrder`.  
   - **SCD Handling:**  
     - Type 2 for `DimUsers` (tracking profile/address changes historically).  
     - Type 1 for `DimCourses` (overwriting price/language updates).  

**Data Warehouse Structure:**  
- **Star Schema:**  
  - **Dimensions:** `DimDate` (time analysis), `DimUsers` (demographics), `DimCourses` (pricing/category hierarchy).  
  - **Facts:** `FactEnrollment` (progress metrics), `FactOrder` (revenue trends), and `FactCarts` (cart behavior).  
  - **Sub-Dimensions:** `SupDimSection` (content structure), `SupDimReq` (prerequisites), `SupDimQuiz` (question types).  

**Security & Compliance:**  
- **Encryption:** Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for data at rest.  
- **Access Control:** Azure AD authentication with role-based permissions (RBAC) for least-privilege access.  
- **Audit Logs:** Tracked via Azure Monitor for compliance reporting.  

**Performance:**  
- Synapse leverages **MPP (Massively Parallel Processing)** for complex OLAP queries.  
- ADF uses **in-memory lookups** (e.g., `DimDate` cached) to accelerate joins.

### 08. Cubes Creation Using SSAS  
![Cube Image](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/08_Cubes%20Creation%20Using%20SSAS/SSAS_PH/Analysis%20SSAS.png)  

**Multidimensional Cubes** were built in SSAS to enable advanced analytics on UdemyDWH:  

1. **Sales & Revenue Cube:**  
   - **Measures:**  
     - `Completed Revenue` (SUM of successful orders).  
     - `Lost Revenue` (pending/canceled orders).  
     - `Average Discount` and `Total Orders`.  
   - **Dimensions:**  
     - `DimDate` (Year → Quarter → Month hierarchy).  
     - `DimStudents` (country, social media presence).  
     - `DimPaymentMethod` (Visa, PayPal splits).  

2. **Enrollment Cube:**  
   - **Measures:**  
     - `Completion Rate` (% with 100% progress).  
     - `Student Engagement Score` (custom formula: 50% progress + 30% grade + 20% rating).  
     - `Average Grade` and `Not Completed Count`.  
   - **Drillthrough:** Course → Section → Lesson details.  

3. **Cart Analysis Cube:**  
   - **Measures:**  
     - `Total Amount` (cart value).  
     - `Total Courses Cart` (distinct course count).  
     - `Abandonment Rate` (inactive carts >30 days).  
   - **KPIs:** Flagged high-value carts (>$200) for targeted campaigns.  

**Technical Implementation:**  
- **Star Schema:** Fact tables (`FactOrder`, `FactEnrollment`, `FactCarts`) linked to conformed dimensions (`DimCourses`, `DimDate`).  
- **MOLAP Storage:** Pre-aggregated data for fast queries (e.g., revenue by quarter).  
- **Incremental Processing:** Daily updates post-ETL to refresh cubes.  
- **Aggregations:** Optimized for time hierarchies (month/quarter/year) and student-course combinations.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Identify discount impact on enrollment rates.  
- Analyze cart abandonment trends by demographics.  
- Track regional revenue growth via Power BI dashboards.

### 09. Reports Creation Using SSRS  
![SSRS GIF](https://github.com/Mohammed1999sstack/Studify_Graduation_Project/blob/main/09_Reporrts%20Creation%20Using%20SSRS/SSRS_PH/Studify%20Reports.gif)  

**ETL & Data Preparation:**  
- **SSIS Workflow:** Extracted data from SSAS cubes (*Sales*, *Enrollment*, *Cart*) into SQL staging tables.  
- **Transformations:** Flattened hierarchies (e.g., `Country → State → City`), replaced nulls with "Unknown," and standardized currency/date formats.  
- **Destination:** Loaded cleansed data into dedicated SQL tables (e.g., `Studify_EnrollmentByCategory`, `Studify_RevenueByLocation`).  

**Core Reports (SSRS):**  
1. **Enrollment by Category:**  
   - **Visuals:** Stacked bars showing course distribution (IT: 28%, Business: 22%).  
   - **Metrics:** `Completion Rate`, `Average Grade`, and `Student Engagement Score`.  
2. **Revenue by Geography:**  
   - **Drill-Down:** Interactive maps from country → state → city, layered with `Total Revenue` and `Average Discount`.  
3. **Cart Analysis:**  
   - **Funnel Charts:** Track cart additions vs. purchases; highlight high-value carts (>$200).  
4. **Instructor Performance:**  
   - **Scorecards:** Combine `Revenue Generated`, `Average Rating`, and student feedback trends.  
5. **Student Progress:**  
   - **Sparklines:** Visualize progress trends; conditional formatting flags at-risk students (<30% progress).  

**Data Sources:**  
- **Cubes:** Leveraged `FactEnrollment` (progress metrics), `FactOrder` (revenue), and `FactCarts` (abandonment rates).  
- **Dimensions:** Linked to `DimCourses` (category/pricing), `DimStudents` (demographics), and `DimDate` (time trends).  

**Validation:** Cross-checked totals against SSAS cube browser and ensured geographic hierarchy integrity (e.g., city-state alignment).

### 10. Dashboards  

#### 10.1 Power BI Dashboards  

##### 10.1.1 Power BI Integration Dashboards
**Integration Workflow:**  
1. **API & Data Pipeline:**  
   - Connected to Studify’s ASP.NET API endpoints (`vw_FactEnrollment`, `VDimUser`, etc.) via Power Query.  
   - Used **DirectQuery** for real-time Azure SQL Database integration (OLTP data).  

2. **ETL & Modeling:**  
   - Transformed raw API/database data into a **star schema** (facts: `Enrollment`, `Orders`; dimensions: `Courses`, `Users`, `Date`).  
   - Implemented DAX measures for KPIs: `Completion Rate`, `Revenue Trends`, `Cart Abandonment Rate`.  

3. **Dynamic Dashboards:**  
   - Collaborated with .NET team to embed dashboards using `<iframe>` with URL parameters (`InstructorID`, `StudentID`).  
   - Enabled **row-level security** for personalized views (e.g., instructors see only their courses).  

4. **Deployment:**  
   - Published to **Power BI Service** with daily refreshes (UTC+02:00 Cairo).
